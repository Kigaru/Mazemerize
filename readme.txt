*****************************************
*	TO CREATE NEW LEVELS		*
*****************************************
The following are the hex values of each pixel 
colors required to be in the level in order for 
the game to be able to render your level in-game.

BLACK (#000000) - WALL
WHITE (#FFFFFF) - NOTHING
GRAY (#777777) - PATH	
RED (#FF0000) - CHEST	
BLUE (#0000FF) - LOCKED DOOR	
YELLOW (#FFFF00) - FINAL DOOR
GREEN (#00FF00) - GOAL
PINK (#FF00FF) - PLAYER START	

I recommend using the pencil tool in MS Paint for this,
as there will be no artifacts left over the different shades
when using a brush.

The saved image place into the /resources/textures folder and
rename it to "level.png", there will be already a level of that
name, so to safekeep it please rename it before adding your own 
map into the game.
